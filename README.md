# Blogserve

This is a little server I've writtent that renders and displays a blog written in Markdown, for learning the Python framework Tornado. It's very simple, but it works! 

Styling done with the [tufte-css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) CSS library, which is amazing. Check it out.
